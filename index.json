But by the early 20th century they had fallen into disrepute, outlawed in many legal jurisdictions and forgotten other than in crime novels and works of fiction. Recently though, academics and scholars have developed a renewed interest in tontine-related longevity pooling schemes with over 100 scientific articles (and counting) published on the topic in the early decades of the 21st century. Then, in the fall of 2022 a Canadian investment company was granted authorisation by regulators to launch a modern version of the tontine, partially encouraged by the above noted scientific research. Motivated by all this activity the 75-minute presentation will review some of the colourful history and literature (1/3), explain the actuarial and financial characteristics of the “modern” structure (1/3) and then focus on some “open” mathematical problems stimulated by recent tontine design.\n","date":1665532800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665532800,"objectID":"a672db92aa4d45967b250220df75d536","permalink":"https://eos-asterisk.netlify.app/ast_event/seminar_3/","publishdate":"2022-10-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/ast_event/seminar_3/","section":"ast_event","summary":"Seminar by Moshe A.

Despite the fact that cyber risk shows distinct characteristics from conventional risks, most existing models for cyber risk in the insurance literature have been purely based on frequency-severity analysis, which was developed for classical property and casualty risks. In contrast, the cybersecurity engineering literature employs different approaches, under which cyber incidents are viewed as threats or hacker attacks acting on a particular set of vulnerabilities. There appears a gap in cyber risk modeling between engineering and insurance literature. This paper presents a novel model to capture this unique dynamics of cyber risk known from engineering and to model loss distributions based on industry loss data and a particular company’s cybersecurity profile. The analysis leads to a new tool for allocating resources of the company between cybersecurity investments and loss-absorbing reserves.\n","date":1654128000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654128000,"objectID":"c8febceaf0a1e8ddf91ce0fd16b3a18e","permalink":"https://eos-asterisk.netlify.app/ast_event/seminar_2/","publishdate":"2022-06-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/ast_event/seminar_2/","section":"ast_event","summary":"Seminar by Alfred Chong from Heriot Watt University","tags":[],"title":"Cyber Risk Assessment for Capital Management","type":"ast_event"},{"authors":["Samal Abdikerimova"],"categories":null,"content":"Time and location  May 16, 2022 KU Leuven, FEB  Abstract Peer-to-peer (P2P) insurance is a decentralized network in which participants pool their resources together to compensate those who suffer losses. The rise of P2P insurance in Western countries, such as Friendsurance and Lemonade, has been viewed a disruptor to the traditional insurance industry in the same way Uber is to the taxi industry. A similar business model of mutual aid, such as Xiang Hu Bao, has become popular in the East, which provides financial support to those in needs and spreads the cost among all participants.\nDespite the fast-changing landscape in this field, there has been scarce literature on the theoretical underpinning of P2P insurance and mutual aid. This paper presents the first effort to build a unified framework to quantify and assess the exchange of risks in a network of participants from different risk classes. Under this framework, the paper aims to address several essential research questions including the fair exchange of heterogeneous risks and the optimality of algorithmic designs under various criteria. The modeling of multi-risk exchange is done with a P2P network structures. We show that not only these network structures can be used to explain the current practice in the industry but also provide new tools to develop better designs. The paper concludes with a comparison of traditional insurance and P2P risk sharing from the standpoint of stability and cost reduction.\n","date":1652659200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652659200,"objectID":"ccbb6fbed75440ad5a4bc769dbdabbe4","permalink":"https://eos-asterisk.netlify.app/ast_event/seminar_1/","publishdate":"2022-05-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/ast_event/seminar_1/","section":"ast_event","summary":"Seminar by Samal Abdikerimova from Illinois University","tags":[],"title":"Peer-to-peer Multi-Risk Insurance and Mutual Aid","type":"ast_event"},{"authors":["Jonas Crevecoeur","Jens Robben","Katrien Antonio"],"categories":null,"content":"Abstract Traditional non-life reserving models largely neglect the vast amount of information collected over the lifetime of a claim. This information includes covariates describing the policy, claim cause as well as the detailed history collected during a claim’s development over time. We present the hierarchical reserving model as a modular framework for integrating a claim’s history and claim-specific covariates into the development process. Hierarchical reserving models decompose the joint likelihood of the development process over time. Moreover, they are tailored to the portfolio at hand by adding a layer to the model for each of the events registered during the development of a claim (e.g. settlement, payment). Layers are modelled with statistical learning (e.g. generalized linear models) or machine learning methods (e.g. gradient boosting machines) and use claim-specific covariates. As a result of its flexibility, this framework incorporates many existing reserving models, ranging from aggregate models designed for run-off triangles to individual models using claim-specific covariates. This connection allows us to develop a data-driven strategy for choosing between aggregate and individual reserving; an important decision for reserving practitioners. We illustrate our method with a case study on a real insurance data set and deduce new insights in the covariates driving the development of claims. Moreover, we evaluate the method’s performance on a large number of simulated portfolios representing several realistic development scenarios and demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of the hierarchical reserving model.\n","date":1651363200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651363200,"objectID":"f4b210109686229ce8507f2e0278a8f5","permalink":"https://eos-asterisk.netlify.app/publication/paper1/","publishdate":"2022-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/paper1/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract Traditional non-life reserving models largely neglect the vast amount of information collected over the lifetime of a claim.

This paper considers the case of a large pool and studies the asymptotic behavior of mortality credits. A law of large numbers and a central-limit theorem are established, as well as simple approximations for a sufficiently large number of participants.
