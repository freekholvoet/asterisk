This initiative is sponsered by the ASTeRISK project. The workshop relates to the third research line of the ASTeRISK project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk-sharing mechanisms have been studied for decades in the actuarial literature, starting with the pioneering work of Karl Borch who investigated equilibrium in a reinsurance market in the early 1960s. Decentralized risk-sharing refers to risk-sharing mechanisms under which the participants in a pool decide to share their risks among each other in such a way that the sum all losses paid from the pool matches the sum of the contributions paid by the participants.  As mentioned above, investigating  how to determine &amp;lsquo;fair&amp;rsquo; contributions in a decentralized risk-sharing problem is an old research problem in the actuarial and risk-sharing literature. The recent interest in a sharing economy, collaborative consumption and decentralized finance, together with recent advances in technology have led to a renewed academic interest in decentralized risk-sharing mechanisms. Moreover, in practice, peer-to-peer (P2P) or collaborative insurance revives early forms of mutual insurance, where the contributions of the many are used to cover the misfortunes of the few, while keeping insurer’s experience in claim settlement and risk-bearing capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking into account these new practical and theoretical evolutions, we have decided to launch an academic forum for research on decentralized risk-sharing and its applications. FADeRiS-2023 is the first of (hopefully) a series of workshops, with the goal of bringing together researchers active in this field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is our pleasure and honor to dedicate this first FADeRiS workshop held at KU Leuven to prof. dr. Marc Goovaerts, one of the most brilliant actuarial researchers of his generation and a great mentor for many Belgian and Dutch actuaries.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Prize-Winning Paper Tackles Machine Learning Actuarial Models</title>
      <link>https://eos-asterisk.netlify.app/ast_event/article_1/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Article in The Actuary Magazine on the award winning paper “Boosting Insights in Insurance Tariff Plans with Tree-Based Machine Learning Methods,” authored by Roel Henckaerts, Marie-Pier Côté, Katrien Antonio and Roel Verbelen. This paper is related to the first and second research line of the ASTeRISK project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract-from-the-article&#34;&gt;Abstract from the article:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits of machine learning (ML) are widespread. It can help organizations get the most out of raw data, and its applications hold the promise of improving lives. The actuarial profession shares in the potential power of ML, but new technologies can be disruptive. ML actuarial models, for example, can be so complex they lack transparency, threatening to weaken consumers’ trust and raise regulators’ suspicions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timely topic of actuarial ML was the focus of a North American Actuarial Journal (NAAJ) article that was chosen as the best in 2021. This prize-winning paper looks inside ML pricing models to understand how they work and explore real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Generating function method for the efficient computation of expected allocations</title>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider a risk portfolio with aggregate loss random variable S=X1+⋯+Xn defined as the sum of the n individual losses X1,…,Xn. The expected allocation, E[Xi×1{S=k}], for i=1,…,n and k∈N, is a vital quantity for risk allocation and risk-sharing. For example, one uses this value to compute peer-to-peer contributions under the conditional mean risk-sharing rule and capital allocated to a line of business under the Euler risk allocation paradigm. This paper introduces an ordinary generating function for expected allocations, a power series representation of the expected allocation of an individual risk given the total risks in the portfolio when all risks are discrete. First, we provide a simple relationship between the ordinary generating function for expected allocations and the probability generating function. Then, leveraging properties of ordinary generating functions, we reveal new theoretical results on closed-formed solutions to risk allocation problems, especially when dealing with Katz or compound Katz distributions. Then, we present an efficient algorithm to recover the expected allocations using the fast Fourier transform, providing a new practical tool to compute expected allocations quickly. The latter approach is exceptionally efficient for a portfolio of independent risks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Old Tontines &amp; Modern Problems</title>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the mid-18th to the late 19th century, tontine schemes were one of the most popular investment products and methods of raising economic capital for long-term projects. But by the early 20th century they had fallen into disrepute, outlawed in many legal jurisdictions and forgotten other than in crime novels and works of fiction. Recently though, academics and scholars have developed a renewed interest in tontine-related longevity pooling schemes with over 100 scientific articles (and counting) published on the topic in the early decades of the 21st century. Then, in the fall of 2022 a Canadian investment company was granted authorisation by regulators to launch a modern version of the tontine, partially encouraged by the above noted scientific research. Motivated by all this activity the 75-minute presentation will review some of the colourful history and literature (1/3), explain the actuarial and financial characteristics of the “modern” structure (1/3) and then focus on some “open” mathematical problems stimulated by recent tontine design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyber risk is an omnipresent risk in the increasingly digitized world that is known to be difficult to quantify and assess. Despite the fact that cyber risk shows distinct characteristics from conventional risks, most existing models for cyber risk in the insurance literature have been purely based on frequency-severity analysis, which was developed for classical property and casualty risks. In contrast, the cybersecurity engineering literature employs different approaches, under which cyber incidents are viewed as threats or hacker attacks acting on a particular set of vulnerabilities. There appears a gap in cyber risk modeling between engineering and insurance literature. This paper presents a novel model to capture this unique dynamics of cyber risk known from engineering and to model loss distributions based on industry loss data and a particular company&amp;rsquo;s cybersecurity profile. The analysis leads to a new tool for allocating resources of the company between cybersecurity investments and loss-absorbing reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peer-to-peer (P2P) insurance is a decentralized network in which participants pool their resources together to 
compensate those who suffer losses. The rise of P2P insurance in Western countries, such as Friendsurance and Lemonade, has been viewed a disruptor to the traditional insurance industry in the same way Uber is to the taxi industry. A similar business model of mutual aid, such as Xiang Hu Bao, has become popular in the East, which provides financial support to those in needs and spreads the cost among all participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the fast-changing landscape in this field, there has been scarce literature on the theoretical underpinning of P2P insurance and mutual aid. This paper presents the first effort to build a unified framework to quantify and assess the exchange of risks in a network of participants from different risk classes. Under this framework, the paper aims to address several essential research questions including the fair exchange of heterogeneous risks and the optimality of algorithmic designs under various criteria. The modeling of multi-risk exchange is done with a P2P network structures. We show that not only these network structures can be used to explain the current practice in the industry but also provide new tools to develop better designs. The paper concludes with a comparison of traditional insurance and P2P risk sharing from the standpoint of stability and cost reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
